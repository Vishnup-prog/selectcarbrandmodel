1. Model - 1 folder has Index.html project will run directly from local html file and I mentioned instructure inside that folder

2.  Model - 2 -> Javascript Project build with Jquery in mvc which in Visual studio 2015. 
    - Used Jquery framework, boostrap for responsive css plugins to run the application
	- Its has Readme file which contains brief explanation of working between view and controller
	
3. Model - 3 -> Angular Project build with Angular in Mvc which in Visual studio 2015.
	- Used Angular framework, boostrap for responsive css plugins to run the application
	- Its has Readme file which contains brief explanation of working between view and controller
	
	Note** Angular.Js and Jquery.JS plugins are installed from manage NuGet Packages
	
	
	**Difference between Javascript Project anf Angular project 
	
	- Brand list dropdown is created on loading the page with viewbag in html code, razor call for dropdown in Javascript Project and Jquery Plugin is Used.
	
	- Calling Viewbag in html code in Javascript project  
   
    - Calling Viewbag list from razor view in Angular Project, but only in Script not in html. So i used Ajax call for even brand name 
 

Note ** brand List api start with "bitte wÃ¤hlen Sie" - "I left this option bitte wÃ¤hlen Sie (choose one please ). may be Its a dropdown for germany standard. So I left as it is"
